### Some time ago...

I was really overwhelmed by the enormous world of javascript.
I was taken aback the very moment I dipped my foot in _it_.


Can you imagine? For almost two years, I am in-denial that I do
not need to learn javascript or atleast try writing scripts with it.
In my defense, I finished my thesis and graduated on college by just
relying on how asp.net C# passes the data to the template and by just
using the default javascript files from the templates, boilerplates,
and frontend frameworks, **as is**. Lucky me, the task that I got
on the first job that I landed is to create a WEB API. Everything is
server side so I didn't have to do anything that concerns frontend
development (_I slipped through the inevitable again_). But....
later on after finishing that project, I was asked to create a webtool
for it, with dashboard, stats, etc. For a moment, I thought I can get
away with it without writing any Javascript again. I thought Django
template will be enough, I was wrong, I wasn't ready, but I have a task
to finish. From that moment, I thought to myself, "You need to learn
javascript, you need it!".

### But before that...

I did what some of you, did too. To search for the very best js framework
like no one ever was. _[Search Google | top javascript 2017]_

<div class="center">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/iwannabe.jpg" style="height: auto; max-width: 70%;" alt="I wanna be the very best">
</div>

Based on that search keyword the top javascript frameworks for 2017 Q2 are ... \*drum rolls\*
**Angular**, **React**, **Ember**, **Meteor**, **Vue**, and many more. Everyone has their
own top tier JS Frameworks. For me, I just need to get started. So I picked the easiest
one that would get me hooked easily. With so many blogs and articles for each of the
frameworks, I already have _these_ keywords in mind as I was skimming the articles and blogs:
EASY and SIMPLE. So maybe you already know now why **Vue.js, I choose you!**.


### Easy and Simple
For me as a beginner, those words are like a magnet. So I chose it right away.
It is very much enough to get me started.

<div class="center">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/choosejs.png" style="height: auto; max-width: 70%;" alt="Choices">
</div>

The very first thing that I did with vuejs is to create a Todo application. I found a step-by-step
video tutorial of it on youtube:Academind. It was very fun. I didn't imagine that coding with frontend would
be very fun and easy. But to be honest, with that video tutorial (<1 hour), with so many magics and all and
I was clueless how vue did all of that, I didn't learn much, but my takeaway is I got to experience the awesomeness of Vue.


Since I was really hyped, I just continued my studying and experimenting. I started from the start.
Code scripts on jsfiddle, learned about the directives, dom interactions, list rendering, and
conditions. After I learned all the basics, I created a simple CRUD application called ideya,
a repository of my ideas. 

<div class="center">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/ideya.png" style="height: auto; max-width: 100%;" alt="I wanna be the very best">
</div>

I was really proud of myself after I finished this simple project. But I'm not still satisfied
with my skills in Vue. As I am skimming through the documentations, I read about the vue-cli,
webpack, components, and many more. I'm not stopping here. There are still lots of exciting
things I have yet to explore in this framework.
