### Once upon a time...

I was really overwhelmed by the enormous world of javascript.
I was taken aback the very moment I dipped my foot in that _ocean_.


Can you imagine? For almost two years, I am in-denial that I do
not need to learn javascript or atleast try writing scripts with it.
In my defense, I finished my thesis and graduated on college by just
relying on how asp.net C# passes the data to the template and by just
using the default javascript files from the templates, boilerplates,
and frontend frameworks, **as is**. Lucky me, the task that I got
on the first job that I landed is to create a WEB API. Everything is
server side so I didn't have to do anything that concerns frontend
development (_I slipped through the inevitable again_). But....
later on after finishing that project, I was asked to create a webtool
for it, with dashboard, stats, etc. For a moment, I thought I can get
away with it without writing any Javascript again. I thought Django
template will be enough, I was wrong, I wasn't ready, but I have a task
to finish. From that moment, I thought to myself, "You need to learn 
javascript, you need it!".
