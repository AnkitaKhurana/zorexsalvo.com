Hi everyone, do you have new project ideas? Have you finished your previous one? I doubt it!

So I have a question to "The Chosen Few" who actually finished their pet projects (_especially if those projects are not your day-to-day job_), how did you do it? Any advice?

Also, I am encouraging everyone who has a working in progress pet project to share theirs in the discussion box. And just maybe, if we knew that anyone may check our project, it may motivate us more to finish it.

I'm fairly new to JS but mine is here: http://shop.zorexsalvo.xyz
