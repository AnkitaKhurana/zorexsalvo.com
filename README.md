This site is created with MaterializeCSS and Jekyll. I've been wanting to offer it as a free jekyll template for those who want to create their own blog site but it isn't good enough.


If you want to contribute, just create a pull request:
 - you can also add comments on the TODO folder; and
 - you can upload screenshots for enhancements also in that folder
