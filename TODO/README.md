Suggestions and Todos
-----
- The two columns of posts under recent posts should be the same height
- "What I'm Doing?" should not end in a question mark, and is maybe more appropriately titled "About Me"
- The footer should contain the same links as the header (blog, github, linkedin, email)
- Add an "a" between the "in continuous loop" part of your short description about yourself.
